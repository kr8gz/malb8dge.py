# Introduction
malb8dge (credit to [@itsmebombie](https://github.com/itsmebombie) for the name) is an esolang that aims to shorten code by removing words and reducing repetitions wherever possible, while still keeping it somewhat easy to understand.

# Documentation

## Running a malb8dge program
malb8dge is written in pure Python. That means there are no requirements, except for a way to run Python files.
The malb8dge interpreter can be run using `py <location of malb8dge file> <.mlb8 source file>`.

An interactive shell also exists, which can be launched by running `py <location of malb8dge file>` with no other arguments.

Alternatively, you can use [@Unzor](https://github.com/Unzor)'s [malb8rowser website](https://malb8dge.seven7four4.repl.co) to test your code online. (It has yet to become good though.)
