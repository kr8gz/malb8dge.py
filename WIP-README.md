# Introduction
malb8dge (credit to [@itsmebombie](https://github.com/itsmebombie) for the name) is an esolang that aims to shorten code by removing words and reducing repetitions wherever possible, while still keeping it somewhat easy to understand.

# Getting started
## Hello, world!
malb8dge is written in pure Python. This means that you will only need Python and nothing else to run the malb8dge interpreter.

To get started, run `py setup.py install` in the directory where you downloaded this repository.
Then create a file called *hello.mlb8* with the following contents:
```
;"Hello, world!"
```

To run this program, simply type `malb8dge hello` in your favorite terminal.
If `Hello, world!` was printed to your console, then congratulations! You have written your first malb8dge program!

Now let's break down this program to understand what exactly is happening.

* `;` is an operator that prints everything that comes after it to the console.
* `"Hello, world!"` is a string, which you probably already know from other programming languages.
(If you have no programming experience, I strongly recommend immediately finding another activity to waste your precious time on.)

Great! It will almost certainly only go downhill from here on.

## Running malb8dge programs
(Thanks to [@DexterHill0](https://github.com/DexterHill0) for helping me with this)

As you might have already noticed, malb8dge files are run using the `malb8dge` command, followed by the location of the .mlb8 file you want to run.

An interactive shell also exists, which can be launched by just running `malb8dge` with no additional arguments.

Alternatively, you can use [@Unzor](https://github.com/Unzor)'s [malb8rowser website](https://malb8dge.seven7four4.repl.co) to test your code online. (It has yet to become good though.)
